# Potato Disease Classification Project

The Potato Disease Classification Project is a machine learning project that aims to classify potato leaf images into different disease categories. This project can be useful for potato farmers and researchers who want to quickly and accurately identify potato diseases in their crops.

## Project Overview

The Potato Disease Classification Project involves the following steps:

1. Data Collection: Collecting potato leaf images from different sources, including public datasets and personal collections.

2. Data Preprocessing: Preprocessing the collected images, including resizing, normalization, and augmentation, to prepare them for training.

3. Model Training: Training a deep learning model using the preprocessed images. The model is trained using a supervised learning approach, where the input images are labeled with the corresponding disease categories.

4. Model Evaluation: Evaluating the trained model on a separate test dataset to measure its performance in classifying potato diseases.

5. Model Deployment: Deploying the trained model to a web application or mobile app, where users can upload their own potato leaf images to classify the diseases.

## Technology Stack

* Python: The project is developed using the Python programming language, which provides a wide range of libraries and frameworks for machine learning and computer vision.

* TensorFlow: TensorFlow is a popular deep learning library that is used for building and training the machine learning model.

* Keras: Keras is a high-level deep learning library that is used for building the neural network architecture.

* tf serving: TensorFlow Serving is an open-source system designed for serving machine learning models in production environments, allowing for easy deployment and scaling of TensorFlow models on a variety of platforms.

## Conclusion

The Potato Disease Classification Project is a useful machine learning project that can assist potato farmers and researchers in identifying potato diseases quickly and accurately. By using deep learning and computer vision techniques, the project can help save time and resources that would otherwise be spent on manual inspection and diagnosis.
